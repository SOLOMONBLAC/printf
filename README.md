#PRINTF PROJECT
The printf project is an ALX Software engineering peer programming task, designed to help students learn the skill of collaborating while continously developing the art of programming. the task consists of 2 mandatory and 13 advanced project. for the projec to effective, the students will have to develop the solutions together. this involves both partners need to have equal as possible git commits to the master branch as possible; the farther from “equal”, the overall score of the project will decrease.

Equal as possible == no more than a 40/60 contribution from the respective partner’s user name (this will be different in the off chance of a third member).

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

#VALUE
Working in a collaborating enviroment helps reduce the burden of work on an individual, promotes learning as each member of team could contribute to the effectiveness of the team as a whole. its one of the coolest form of education and when people click, its bound to be a worth while experience. however, it has been observed to be relatively difficult at times which could reduce the rate of productivity until the team begins to gel.

#TEAM
This printf projec is to be carried out by haykay chukwuka Akibor and Chibike Nwajiobi. both are ALX student from Cohort 13.
